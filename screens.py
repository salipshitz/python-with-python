Unlike 6th grade math, 7th grade math, 8th grade math, 9th grade math (Algebra I), 10th grade math (Geometry), 11th grade math (Algebra II), 12th grade math(Trigonometry?), college math(Calculus, Linear algebra, etc, etc, etc, and etc.), and some high school and college science(physics), variables in coding can have names longer than 1 letter with subscript.

I think it's False. Wait nevermind it's true.), an array which stores an array of values surrounded in brackets where all the values are seperated by ,s (e.g. [\"Why?\", \"Are we stronger than the elements?\", \"What's yellow and dangerous?\", \"What do you get when you multiply six by seven?\", \"How many Vogons does it take to change a lightbulb?\", \"How many roads must a man walk down?\", 42, True, [\"Waaaait... an array inside an array?\", \"that's cray-cray\"], \"Is the array done yet?\", False,...] you get the idea.), a dictionary which is basically a dictionary for variables (e.g. ages = {\"Bob\": 100, \"Me\": 11}) and sooooo on and soooo forth")
